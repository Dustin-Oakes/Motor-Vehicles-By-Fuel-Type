Our graph shows that the battery electric vehicle(BEV) is by far the most popular compared to the plug in hybrid electric vehicle(PEV). Since 2011 there have been a total of 82,575 BEV registered in the state of Washington compared to only 26,555 PEV.

# Bar graph

# Stacked bar graph

Joy will put together a stacked bar graph that demostrates the most popular model of vehicle by county.

According to the bar graph that shows the most popular Brands in WA, we knows that the top four popular brands are Tesla, Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan. As a result, we would like to know vehicle brand distribution in each county. We decided to use stacked bar graph so that we could see the brand distribution in each county clearly. The stacked bar graph shows Tesla is the most popular electric vehicle brand in each county. And King county owns the most electric cars, followed by Snohomish,  Pierce, and Clark county.
