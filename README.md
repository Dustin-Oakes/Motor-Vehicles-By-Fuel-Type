# Motor-Vehicles-By-Fuel-Type

Group 3 compiled hybrid vs. electric vehicle data from car dealerships across Washington State from 2011 - present. With this data, we wanted to discover:


# **Analysis**

# Bar graph 

Angel will put together the bar graph that demonstrates which type of vehicle is the most popular in WA since 2011.

First we were asked to determine the most popular electric vehicle type across the entire state of Washington since 2011. Our graph shows that the battery electric vehicle(BEV) is by far the most popular compared to the plug in hybrid electric vehicle(PEV). Since 2011 there have been a total of 82,575 BEV registered in the state of Washington compared to only 26,555 PEV.

# Line graph

Rob will put together a line graph demonstrating the popularity of hybrid vs. electric vehicles year over year since 2011.

# Bar graph

David will put together a bar graph that shows the most popular Brands in Washington. (brands sales over 1,000 units.) 

# Stacked bar graph

Joy will put together a stacked bar graph that demostrates the most popular model of vehicle by county.

According to the bar graph that shows the most popular Brands in WA, we knows that the top four popular brands are Tesla, Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan. As a result, we would like to know vehicle brand distribution in each county. We decided to use stacked bar graph so that we could see the brand distribution in each county clearly. First, we included all the county and the stacked bar graph shows King county owns the most electric cars, followed by Snohomish,  Pierce, and Clark county.

However, other countys' information didn't show clearly because of large amount in King county, we also generate a graph that exclude King county. The figure shows Tesla is the most popular brand in all county, followed by Chevrolet or Nissan.

# Heat Map

Dustin will create a heat map displaying the general locations of the dealerships that sold the most non-gas vehicles.

The heatmap shows that, in general, major cities tend to be the locations that most non-gas vehicles are being sold. There are some outliers on the I-5 near Canada that are interesting, and some cities appear to be outperforing larger counterparts (notably, Olympia, with a modest population of 55k, exceeds expectations for its size and is a large bright red dot on the map). It is not a surprise though that the recomendation for our hypothetical client is still Washington's most populous city, Seattle.

# Pie graph

Trish will create a pie graph that demostrates a detailed view of which counties purchased relevant vehicles over the span of 2011-present.
